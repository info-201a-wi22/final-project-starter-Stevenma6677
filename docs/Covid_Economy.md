**Abstract**
Our main question with this project is how has COVID-19 affected people **economically**. In order to address this question, we will look at data sets that have to do with lost work hours during the pandemic. We plan to analyze this data and estimate losses to **different citizens**.  

**Keywords**
_Coronavirus_  _Economy_ _Jobs_ _Salary_

**Introduction**
Until _2022_, coronavirus has greatly impacted our society in different ways. This pandemic causes lots of people to lose their jobs, families, or even life. For our project, we want to discuss how coronavirus has affected the world economy from different perspectives. And our data sets will mainly focus on workers' salaries, income situations in different areas, stocks, etc.

**Design Situation**

Our project has a topic of concern being the well being of the general population during the times of the pandemic. The main element of our project is economic affect, but that element also affects many other parts of life such as food availability, happiness levels, and general quality of life. We can see that covid has impacted this through related work such as [The implications of covid-19](https://www.kff.org/coronavirus-covid-19/issue-brief/the-implications-of-covid-19-for-mental-health-and-substance-use/). The key economic question being asked is to what degree were workers and dependents affected, and how did that effect impact other areas of life.

_Human Values_
The main human values within our topic of concern are wellness, health, and equality. These originate from the nature of the topic being discussed, which is the effect of a pandemic. This is bound to cause issues with human values by the way our society is structured and how that structure will affect the response to the pandemic.

_Direct Stakeholders_
The direct stakeholders on this information are economists, employees, company owners, news media, and politicians.

_Indirect Stakeholders_
The indirect stakeholders of this information are essentially everyone on the planet as it is a worldwide data set and the pandemic and economy has affected everyone. We can see this is true through other works, such as [Impact of covid-19 on people's livelihoods](https://www.who.int/news/item/13-10-2020-impact-of-covid-19-on-people's-livelihoods-their-health-and-our-food-systems).

_Possible Benefits and Harms_
The possible benefits of this data set is to help understand who and where was most affected and possibly help direct a course of action or motivate change through social pressure by making this data easy to understand and accessible. If more people are able to access and utilize this information, then hopefully solutions will be discovered more quickly. Unfortunately, this data may also lead to those most in need to be accidentally overlooked as the demographic groups in each country are very limited and split by gender. While this may help with understanding a gender gap, if other minoritized groups are more greatly affected we would not be able to discover that due to limitations within the data set. We can already see this happen currently in similar works to ours like [racial ethnic disparities](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/community/health-equity/racial-ethnic-disparities/index.html).

**Research questions**

_Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, how many people lost their jobs?_
According to today’s data, there are 310,000 new cases found in America. Some of the patients only have light symptoms but there are still numbers of people who get the virus and feel sick so they can not go to work and needs to stay at home. So people have to quit their job since they are sick and avoid to affect others. At this time, a lot of families lost their source of income and could not solve this situation.

_How many companies or stores close during 2020-2022?_
Since more and more people get affected by the coronavirus and quit their jobs. Numerous stores and companies do not have enough workers to support their basic operations so they have to close the company. And during this pandemic, restaurants, and entertainment are closed since no one comes.

_How much money had countries spent on helping to solve this situation?_
At this point, an individual’s power becomes less and less. Only government can help its society to overcome the pandemic.

**The Dataset**

_Size and Complexity_
Our initial dataset has a size and complexity of 283 observations and 9 variables. What is represented by our data is country and the total employed hours per week. The variables included in this data are weekly hours, percentage of hours lost, hours lost, percentage of hours lost, ratio of dependents, employed female with age 25+, employed male age 25+, and the ratio of total weekly hours worked to population aged 15-64. What is excluded is the actual economic effect, average salary, wealth level affected, and smaller subregions of the country and how they were individually affected.

_Data Provenance_
The data was collected by lost in 2020, for the purpose of helping create estimates on employment and economy analysis. It is devoted to social justice and recognizes human and labour rights to pursue the ideal that labor peace is essential to prosperity. It is trustworthy as it is a Nobel Peace Prize awarded UN agency, and it is the first and oldest specialized agency. We obtained the data through a google data search and then made sure the data was from a reputable source.

_Data Origins_
The origins of the data in the data set are the ilostat data statistics which were then organized into tables breaking down the data with subsections based on factors about the demographics of those affected. The ilostat website states that they collect their data through microdata and collection of household survey datasets, which may be different from those nationally reported depending on the extent that country applies international statistical standards. Automated processes are also used by ilostat to collect and process data from national statistical offices in order to more efficiently collect and report this data. Finally, there is an annual ILOSTAT questionnaire to collect data with limited dissemination platforms as well as non-household survey data. This questionnaire has a response rate of 80% globally and 50% of member states.

**Expected Implications**

_Due to the decrease in worker’s number, it is important for designers to think about how to manage existing resources to fulfill needs for jobs._

_Companies need to start managing their plan for the future and strategies that make the economy run and make profits._

_The data about the economy for covid can help the government to establish a better structure to overcome the problems and balance different areas’ financial needs. At the same time, using this data can help technologists to develop a better application to manage the affected people._

**Limitations**
The limitations we need to address are the methods in which data was collected and organized for our dataset, what biases could have affected the collection and organization to the data in our data set, and the limit of information in just a single data set. The ways we could overcome these is through adding in additional data sets to cross analyze this data through different lenses and perspectives. We could also do independent research and incorporate that by creating functions based on that research to analyze the data further.
